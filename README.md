# Love Sandwiches || Python Project

## A simple python application that interacts with google sheets

Reads and updates information on a google sheet using the google API.  
User inputs 6 figures which are the numbers for each type of sandwich sold  
The application then submits those numbers to the google sheet and calculates how much surplus there was today  
Also calculates and reports back how much stock to make for tomorrow based on last 5 days average  
  
Works as a terminal only application  
Requires a creds.json file to access spreadsheets (which I couldn't include for obvious privacy/safety reasons)
